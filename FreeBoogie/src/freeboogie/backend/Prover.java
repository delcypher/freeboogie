/**
 * A prover can be used to check if a formula is valid.
 *
 * The formula must be built using a {@code TermBuilder} obtained
 * by calling {@code getBuilder}, otherwise you are on your own.
 * The validity of a formula is checked using {@code isValid()}
 * and it is done in the context give by the assumption stack; A
 * detailed answer (such as counterexamples) can be obtained by a
 * subsequent call to {@code getDetailedAnswer}.
 *
 * As a convenience, provers offer "assumption frames" thru the
 * methods {@code push()} and {@code pop()}. A call to {@code
 * pop()} should {@code retract()} all assumptions since the
 * corresponding {@code push()}.
 *
 * The user can forcibly {@code terminate()} the prover, thereby
 * releasing most resources (memory, file handles,...).
 *
 * In the event that the prover dies a {@code ProverException}
 * should be thrown and the prover restarted. The user code
 * should be able to assume that the prover is in the state it
 * was before the failing operation was attempted.
 * 
 * TODO add properties, like timelimit
 *
 * @param <T> the type of terms
